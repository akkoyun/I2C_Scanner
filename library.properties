sentence=Master I2C Bus Device Scanner.
paragraph=The Two-Wire interface is extremely useful for connecting multiple devices, as they can all share the same two pins (plus a ground return). This is because the devices are "addressable". Each device needs to have a unique address in the range 0x03 to 0x77. This tool scans the master I2C bus and reports connected devices.
